# FiveM Automated Server Slots
This resource is a simple yet effective script designed to dynamically adjust server slots based on the number of players connected. Ideal for servers aiming to maintain an optimal player experience, it ensures that the server always appears full. As more players join, the slot count increases, and as players leave, it decreases accordingly. This dynamic adjustment keeps your server looking active and lively at all times.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release.
2. Drag DiscordAPI into your resource folder.
3. Go to your server.cfg, and write "start automated-server-slots".

That's it! If everything went correctly, the next time you start your server, you'll see automated-server-slots outputting messages within the console.
